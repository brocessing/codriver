## :oncoming_police_car:  about

Copilote is a minigame where you control a robber and have to espace from the police. <br>
You're not the driver but the in-car GPS — you can only control the vehicle with your voice.

This is a one-month project created for the [GROW Event](http://www.grow.paris/fr) in November 2017.

<br>

## :cactus: demo

Try it on *[https://brocessing.github.io/copilote](https://brocessing.github.io/copilote)*

<br>

## :speech_balloon: orders
* `turn left` / `tourne à gauche`
* `turn right` / `tourne à droite`
* `turn back` / `fais demi-tour`
* `go straight` / `continue tout droit`
* `speed up` / `accélère`
* `speed down` / `ralenti`
* _... and a bunch of hidden commands_

<br>

## :warning: warning
* It works **really better** with an external mic instead of the internal one of your monitor / laptop
* We use the `SpeechRecognition` part of the Speech API, only available on Chrome
* It's pratically untested in English and works better in French
* It's one of our first medium-sized webgl project, it's unoptimized and don't work on RNO computer.
